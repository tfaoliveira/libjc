CPU i7-6500U @ 2.5GHz (with turbo boost disabled)
third party libs compiled in static mode;
all measurements taken in supercop benchmark framework (some bindings were required);
for each message length tested:
- 16k measurements were taken over 3 loops; best median of the 3 loops was selected;
messages lengths tested:
-from 32 to 512 every message length was measured (increment factor of 1)
-from 512 to 4096: increment of 32 (512, 544, 576, ...)
-from 4096 to 16384: increment of 1024 (4096, 5120, 6144, ...)
